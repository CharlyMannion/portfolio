                <h1>Charly Mannion</h1>
                <p>I am a full stack developer and current student at Northcoders, a Coding Bootcamp. After completing a History degree, I worked as a Finance Technology Consultant at EY and RBS before deciding to pursue a career as a developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a flexible thinker, a keen learner, and I have a curiosity for both people and tech. I am drawn to coding as I find the problem-solving and collaborative working style to be fun, rewarding and satisfying. I am excited to start my first role after
                    a period absence from work due to personal matters. This experience strengthened my resolve to become a skilled engineer.
